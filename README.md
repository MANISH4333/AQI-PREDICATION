## Introduction/Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict AQI.

## Live Model
- Tensorflow Model: https://aqi-nn.streamlit.app/

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains dataset(s) used in the project.
- `models/`: Contains machine learning models implemented in the project.
- `images/`: Contains results obtained from model training and evaluation.
- `exp/`: Contains experimental model which perform certainly better than the model on the main branch
- `DL_Models`: Tensorflow trained AQI Models

Technologies used -React,express,NodeJS,Mongo DB,Typescript,python(Numpy, pandas,Streamlit,Tensorflow models
